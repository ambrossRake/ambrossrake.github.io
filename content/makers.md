Whether you’re learning to solder your first circuit or designing an off-grid automation system, there’s always something to build.

### 🌿 Sustainable Innovation  
We explore how technology can coexist with nature — from **solar-powered systems** and **hydroponic farming**, to **recycled-material builds** and **low-waste prototyping**.  

### 🤝 Collaboration & Open Source  
Our community thrives on sharing.  
All Gridless One projects aim to be **open-source**, **documented**, and **replicable**, so others can learn and create along with us.
